This however is a dangerous one. With the LGBTQ+ movement leading the charge, It wishes to re define the meaning of marriage, Family, Sex and the difference between man and womanhood. Firstly, With the subject of marriage. Within our Western culture, For centuries, Marriage has always been seen as an institution for a man and women to raise a family. To this day it is still the best way to raise children hands down. Now apart from a very few exceptions a same sex marriage can not provide that for obvious reasons. Upon the subject of sex, Gay sex can not be seen as moral as it does not allow the procreation of children. One cannot just separate procreation and pleasure as otherwise sex becomes meaningless and casual. The effects of the sexual revelation can be seen today, With the rise of STDs, Teenage pregnancy, Rise of abortions, Pornography, Sex trafficking and the list goes on. Moreover it is visible within LGBTQ+ organised Pride parades that sexual deviancy is promoted by a visible few, Which then increases the number of problems that I have already stated. However it must be understood that one should NEVER hate or hurt anyone who commits these acts of sexual disorder, As heterosexuals can be just as bad, But we should help correct each other with compassion."}, {"title": "Nothing is wrong nor right", "body": "We live in a modern society were we consider things to be correct or incorrect. However, This modern system is biased towards many things. Whereas humans have adjusted to these things in a certain manner to determine the role of an object. For example; A tooth brush. It can be used for many different things, However most consider it to be used as a utensil to clean the inner caverns of our mouths. Moving towards this topic, Sexuality is but a biased thing in our modern society. To conclude, Nothing is correct or incorrect. It is just a manner of how we as a modern society consider things."}, {"title": "How do you know your gender and sex don't match?", "body": "A person came to our school to do a presentation on the LGBTQ+. She explained that if a person doesn't feel that their gender matches the one they are assigned at birth, We can change our gender. But the thing is, How do you know that your gender and sex don't match? Is it simply that you want to be another sex, For example, You're a girl and you really want to be a boy."}, {"title": "People are people, Their choices are either net good or bad.", "body": "There isn't any grey area where a person can openly throw out morality in one area so long as they pay it off in other areas. Each decision individually is tested against the limits of morality, And if you fall outside those limits you risk being burned. People know beforehand the consequences of choosing a deviant sexual relationship (they could choose any). It doesn't have to even be homosexual. The worst part of a homosexual relationship is that you bring another person down to your level \u2026 like using (drugs) with another person. In doing anything with them you empower them and make them feel like its normal and ok. Then that sentiment sticks with them like any addiction. Hell, People with addictions even think sometimes they were born that way, Predestined to use, As if they have nowhere else to turn. Its all just a denial to help justify to themselves what they are doing. The problems are self evident:1) Over emphasis on sexual pleasures \u2026 ones that can never amount to offspring as it was meant to (you can buck Darwinism if you don't like that). 2) you deprive yourself the true balance of having a hetero relationship. 3) You open yourself up to throwing out other good guidance from sources such as the bible, Just because it doesn't reflect the way you want to be. 4) You act against the idea that people are unique in that you have determined that there is no opposite sex partner for you. (prison stats clearly demonstrate that homosexuality is situational based \u2026 or worse that if people are born this way that they are also predisposed criminals)   Predisposition for crime though might support what I said above in all the other points, Though im not saying that they have that at this point. 5) Exhibit selfishness in that they are willing to walk such a hard uphill battle against nature for their own sexual pleasure. Or the fact that they don't walk what they perceive to be an even harder line by following through with the morally right path that's been presented to them. Just all round its a very belittling practice. It doesn't buy any respect for the human race, It makes us look like animals. It demonstrates that we can't handle emotions or look past our basic instincts. Its primal and disgusting, As primal and disgusting as violence against innocents is. Everytime I see it it makes me lose faith in mankind. Worse yet seeing it propped up by a morally flawed society as if a social norm."}, {"title": "LGBTQ+ is spreading the wrong message", "body": "Young children in elementary school are now being exposed to the LGBTQ community. This is dangerous, Manipulative, And damaging to our society. Children as young as 7 are claiming that they are trans, Gay, Lesbian, Etc. This is ridiculous. These children are far too young to know what gender they like or if they are in fact the opposite gender. A 7 year old should have no attraction whatsoever to another person in terms of a relationship, Serious or sexual. However, The LGBTQ community and their message spreading is enabling our youth to learn about these topics. When these children are influenced, They listen, As they are easily manipulated. This is turning people who may not be LGBTQ into members of the community. If we want a generation of delusional and wrongly influenced youth, Then yes, LGBTQ is great. However, That is not what we want, And the LGBTQ community stands in the way of a community that is born of free choice, Influencing children at such a young age."}, {"title": "But only the movement", "body": "On their own the people in these groups aren't too bad but the movement is the problem.

These unique ship types and upgrade paths lend themselves well to the different missions of Homeworld: Cataclysm, Featuring scenarios where players must scavenge weapons from ancient wrecks, Infiltrate enemy facilities with mimic craft, And research ways to counter and destroy the warped spaceships taken over by the Beast. Homeworld Cataclysm Has A More Character Driven Story Than Previous GamesHomeworld_ Cataclysm Homeworld_ EmergenceThe storylines of Homeworld 1 and Homeworld 2 are plot-driven rather than character-driven, Focusing on the beauty of outer space and the sleek lines of the spaceships players can build. Karen S'jet, The protagonist of the Homeworld franchise, Even goes so far as to cybernetically fuse herself with the mothership in both Homeworld 1 and Homeworld 2, A metaphor of sorts for how the spaceships are the true stars of the show. The story of Homeworld: Cataclysm is tense, Horrific in tone, And smaller in scale compared to the sweeping, Grand hero's journey of the original Homeworld 1, And as a result, Manages to have more intimate moments of character growth. The Bentusi, Living starships and traders who occupy the \"Wise Old Mentor\" archetype in Homeworld 1, Reveal a more fallible, Human side to them in Homeworld: Cataclysm, Fleeing their responsibilities out of fear of being consumed and enslaved by the Beast. The Fleet Commander of the Homeworld: Cataclysm mothership, In contrast to the stoic narrations of Karen S'jet, Goes through a very emotional character arc, Starting off as the gruff captain of a mining vessel horrified at the assimilating behavior of the Beast, Growing into a hardened warship captain, And from there into a charismatic leader who talks the Bentusi traders out of abandoning the galaxy with an impassioned speech worthy of Captain Kirk. Even the villainous force known as the Beast has a richness of character, Cruelly interacting with players using the memories and voices of the crews they've devoured, Their attempts at manipulation and strategy hindered by a childlike inability to see other lifeforms as anything but food. All in all, Homeworld: Cataclysm was ahead of its time in many ways, Pioneering gameplay innovations adopted by Homeworld 2 and introducing a character-driven sci-fi horror story that foreshadowed future games such as Dead Space.

BY COLEMAN GAILLORETOHomeworld_ Cataclysm Homeworld_ Emergence Mothership Kuun-LanRecent development updates for the space opera RTS Homeworld 3 have renewed people's interest in the Homeworld games, Famous for combining the mechanics of real-time strategy with three-dimensional starship combat and the exploration of vast zones of space. The most innovative game in the Homeworld franchise, However, Is arguably the most obscure. Homeworld: Cataclysm, A spin-off game by Barking Dog Studios, Introduced new gameplay mechanics and spaceship designs to the series along with a distinctly character-driven story containing heavy horror elements. In Homeworld 1, A crew of space colonists in a great mothership embark on an epic journey to Hiigara, The lost planet of origin for their species, All while being pursued by the fleets of the galactic empire that exiled their ancestors to the edge of the galaxy. In Homeworld 2, The Hiigarans must defend their re-claimed home-world from invading space nomads while unlocking secrets hidden away in the ruins of an ancient precursor civilization. In the gameplay of both Homeworld titles, A banana-shaped mothership hyper-space jumps to new regions of space, Harvests local resources, And slowly assembles a massive star-fleet of fighter-craft, Corvettes, Frigates, And capital ships.  Homeworld_ Cataclysm Homeworld_ Emergence Mothership Kuun-LanHomeworld: Cataclysm (released in 2000 and currently available on GoG under the name Homeworld: Emergence) takes place between Homeworld 1 and 2, Focusing on a clan of space miners who accidentally unleash a flesh-consuming, Ship-corrupting contagion called the Beast, Then convert their mining vessels and equipment into weapons of war to hunt down and destroy the monster they set free. Homeworld: Cataclysm introduced several useful quality of life features to the original Homeworld's gameplay, Such as the ability to speed up time and removing the need for fighter-craft to refuel; it also took Homeworld's base premise in interesting new directions.  Homeworld: Cataclysm Mixed Up The Formula Of Ship Design &amp; TacticsHomeworld_ Cataclysm Homeworld_ Emergence Capital ShipThe protagonists of Homeworld: Cataclysm are the miners and engineers of Kiith Somtaaw, A lower-class clan of the Hiigarian people who seek their fortune among the stars. After tampering with an ancient piece of space wreckage and unleashing the Beast contagion (similar in behavior to the Protomolecule from The Expanse), Kiith Somtaaw (and the players, By extension) are forced to modify their mining infrastructure into deadly weapons of war. \""}, {"title": "Space Farce & Kirk", "body": ". . . .

Rohan Philip in FeatureSlider On September 22, 2013     Page 42 of 99 59. Garrus Vakarian (Mass Effect Series)\"Garrus Vakarian is to Commander Shepard, Like what Spock was to Captain Kirk, In Star Trek. They both shared an amazing friendship and went through hardships. Garrus is a natural leader and fought side by side with Shepard. He is one tough Turian and is an excellent sniper and warrior. He is one of the most loved characters in the Mass Effect universe. \""}, {"title": "Mass Effect, Captain Kirk Tradition, Part 3", "body": ". . . The article lastly says\"Almost everyone else leaves you or messes with you at some point. But no matter what he's doing, Garrus is always ready to drop everything and charge into the hell of Shepard's choosing, At their side, \" says Prolix. \"He's always there for you. He's a constant lamp in the fog of war, And he clearly feels the same way about Shepard. That's special. While other crewmates are always getting themselves into trouble and needing to be bailed out, Or making demands that of course go terribly sideways, Or starting fights, Or endlessly hitting on you, There's never drama with Garrus. \"When you're Femshep and you romance him, That dynamic kind of puts them in this role of the 'Normandy Mom &amp; Dad' in Mass Effect 2 and 3, Which is adorable also. \"(Image credit: BioWare)Of course, None of this gets around the fact that Garrus also has a granite exoskeleton, Flapping, Unseemly mandibles, And a massive scar carved across his face. Mass Effect is a horny videogame, And its universe has no shortage of sexy aliens in the Captain Kirk tradition, But Garrus does not fit that archetype. He wasn't romanceable in the first game, But Liara, Who belongs to the Asari\u2014a species who've been given lore justifications for being extremely hot\u2014absolutely was. As far as Dawn is concerned, Garrus's scarred beak is part of his appeal. He wouldn't be the same without it. \"I know I\u2019ve basically gushed over the emotional and personality aspects of Garrus Vakarian, But that voice, Those scars? I\u2019ll take one Turian over a hundred Asari any day of the week, \" she says. \"Those scars are pretty cute too, Totally drives the ladies wild. \"So good luck to Garrus Nation, As their husband finally returns from war. Perhaps someday BioWare will retcon the end of Mass Effect 3 completely, And we can witness the salad days of Garrus and Shepard: both of them retired and chilling beyond the outer rim, With no simmering interpersonal feuds tearing up the Normandy chemistry. Until then, We will always have those first three games, And the only man we could ever count on. \""}], "con_arguments": [{"title": "Buy Adderall Online", "body": "Buy Adderall Online Without Prescription in USA | Adderall Overnight Delivery in US and CanadaAdderall is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - ADHD.

In other words, Only when the harm caused by an action is equivalent to taking a life should a death penalty be considered. It goes without saying that sexual practices or gender identity can never fulfill this standard. Nobody dies as a result of being too close to people who are having gay sex. Nobody dies as a result of passing by a transgender person in the street. The opposition states that these are \"dangerous ideologies\" perpetuated by \"cultural Marxists\". This is patently false, As gay sex has been observed both in nature and in societies that developed before Karl Marx's writings or any of their derivatives. The statement that gay sex \"spreads sexually transmitted diseases\" is irrelevant, As any kind of sex is capable of spreading disease without proper protection and testing. The claim that it \"lessens population growth\" is similarly useless, As population growth reduces in response to a vast number of other variables, Most notably education and standard of living. Blaming gay people for a decrease in population growth arbitrarily ignores the other, More substantive influences. The claim that either gay or transgender people are \"degenerating the nation\" is entirely without substantiation. The opposition does not care, Of course, Because the intent is only to latch onto a convenient scapegoat for the systemic failures of late-stage capitalism. The claim that sexual and gender minorities are grasping for privileges as the cost of the majority is just as unfounded as the rest. The only \"privilege\" I have ever seen agitated for is the privilege to live without the threat of violence or oppression. Clearly the opposition does not respect the right of other people to live as they see fit. It is my opinion that those the opposition threatens should respond in kind.

You can see that in the last week the protests have become less violent, Coincidentally just as the police force in the USA becomes more civil as they are globally condemned for their response to the protests. Some statues have been removed, However many protestors instead want people to recognise that the historical people we hold up as champions were not perfect, And had some deep flaws based on society at the time. Just as many are requesting that especially egregious figures instead be replaced by equally as important figures who didn't hold white supremacist views. Although White individuals may be killed more often by Police than Black individuals, You would expect this when they make up around 60% of the population compared to 26%. When taking into consideration percent of the population by skin colour, Black individuals are 3 times as more likely to be killed than their White colleagues. Police are also not charged 99% of the time, Which shows just how much they get away with. At most they may have to switch county, But they are still able to remain police officers. ISIS tries to kill people while Black Lives Mater doesn't, So there is no sane comparison.

Also calling African-American people criminals without any evidence is racist, Making you, At least partly racist. Black Lives Matter has nothing to do with religion so it cannot be Anti-Semitic (hatred against Judaism).

Even though this is more than enough to doubt his culpability, Fear was the prime motivation in the decision making. With 300 blm protestors outside the court and maxine waters literal call for violence, Clearly the motivation was based on fear and not on justice. Plus the fact they came to a decision extremely fast and this being a hugely televised spectacle (the death of Floyd with the subsequent blm \"protests\"), People had a pre existing opinion based on the media narrative (that undeniably exist considering Project Veritas CNN exposure video of one of the heads of it stating they wanna \"help blm\" while being so called \"objective journalism\")."}]}
